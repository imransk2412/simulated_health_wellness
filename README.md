# Tailoring Wellness Programs via Clustering

This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniquesâ€”K-Means and Agglomerative (Hierarchical) Clusteringâ€”to segment participants in a workplace wellness program based on key behavioral and health features. The aim is to design targeted and personalized wellness interventions that improve health outcomes, boost engagement, and reduce healthcare costs.

##  Dataset

The simulated dataset includes **500 participants** with the following features:
- `Exercise_Time_Min` â€“ Average daily exercise time (minutes)
- `Healthy_Meals_Per_Day` â€“ Count of healthy meals consumed daily
- `Sleep_Hours_Per_Night` â€“ Average sleep duration (hours)
- `Stress_Level` â€“ Stress level on a scale of 1 to 10
- `BMI` â€“ Body Mass Index

All features were standardized using `StandardScaler`, and PCA (Principal Component Analysis) was applied to enhance cluster separability and reduce dimensionality.

##  Methods

Three clustering approaches were evaluated:
- **K-Means** (original features)
- **Agglomerative Clustering** (Hierarchical)
- **K-Means with PCA-transformed features**

###  Cluster Evaluation
- The **elbow method** was used to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- **Silhouette Scores** were calculated to measure cluster cohesion and separation.

##  Results

| Clustering Model       | Silhouette Score |
|------------------------|------------------|
| K-Means (original)     | 0.1516           |
| Hierarchical           | 0.1363           |
| K-Means on PCA         | **0.3626**       |

The best clustering was achieved with **K-Means using PCA**, producing **three well-separated clusters**:

### Cluster Profiles:
- **Cluster 1: Health-Minded** â€“ High exercise, healthy diet, normal BMI, low stress
- **Cluster 2: At-Risk** â€“ Low exercise, poor diet, high BMI, high stress
- **Cluster 3: Moderate** â€“ Moderate habits, borderline BMI, slightly high stress

## ðŸ“‰ Visualizations

- **Elbow Plot** â€“ Optimal number of clusters = 3
- **Dendrogram** â€“ Hierarchical groupings
- **PCA Scatterplot** â€“ Clear cluster separation
- **Correlation Heatmap** â€“ Stress positively correlated with BMI, while exercise was negatively correlated with BMI

##  Recommendations

- **Segment-Specific Content**: Design tailored programs for each behavioral group
- **Digital Nudges**: Use app notifications and wearables for real-time support
- **Re-Clustering**: Periodically reassess users to adapt interventions over time
- **Feedback Loop**: Collect user feedback to refine clustering strategies

##  Limitations

This study used simulated data. Real-world validation is necessary to confirm the clustering effectiveness across diverse demographics and clinical scenarios.

##  Conclusion

Clustering techniques, especially K-Means with PCA, enable meaningful segmentation of wellness program participants. Personalized interventions based on clustering insights can enhance relevance, engagement, and outcomesâ€”supporting a shift from generalized wellness programs to **data-driven personalization**.
